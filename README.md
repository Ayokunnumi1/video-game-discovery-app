# React + TypeScript + Vite Short Note

1. To render a list in JSX, we use the ‘array.map()’ method. When mapping items, each item must have a unique key, which can be a string or a number. The listed items are stored in an array.

2.We use the state hook to define state (data that can change over time) in a component. A hook is a function that allows us to tap into built-in features in React.

3. Components can optionally have props (short for properties) to accept input.
